        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Minecraft, you might or might know this game but i am playing it from 2 years now. Now the reason why i like this game so much is because its advetures and very cool you can try it for your self on minecrfat.net.So this game has a lot of updates over the last 10 years
            the first one was not that intersting and the graphics were bad but about 10 years later this game is so popular that there over 2 billion downloads wanna know why well, there is a lot you see there is somthing called mobs thats what makes this game fun there is mainly a dragon living in the dimension of the end and there is skeletons,zombies,zombie pigmens and piglins. First, lets talk about piglins these guys trade for gold and they are a huge part to beat the game which I LIKE SOOO MUCH insteade of killing endermens"i will talk about it latter" you can mine some gold deep underground with a pickaxe iron pickaxe recomanded and the other thing which is super cool to know that there is a mob called blaze which lives in the nether you kill it to get blaze rods which you turn it into powder with the help of a crafting table made with wood and you take the powder of blazes and pearls from the piglins mix them and you get eye of ender for more info go two the my videos section and hope you beat the game like i do i love this game. By the way my name is Kanishk. see ya </p>
